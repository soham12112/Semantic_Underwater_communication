=== GENERATED PROMPT ===

Final Prompt:
Underwater ROV documentary footage in turquoise-green water with poor visibility. Complex camera sequence: smooth push-in and lateral truck movement right, followed by combined pedestal up, pull-out, and panning left, then multiple alternating vertical and lateral movements with pans in both directions, ending with push-in and pan left. Ambient underwater lighting, minimal particulate matter, documentary GoPro wide-angle style with smooth professional camera motion throughout.

Negative Prompt:
Clear blue water, artificial lighting, surface reflections, fish or marine life, people, text overlays, shaky erratic camera motion, bright saturated colors, close-up details, coral reefs, rocks, wreckage, synthetic appearance, CGI elements
